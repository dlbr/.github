DLBR
**Ultra-precise infrastructure for transport logistics and telemetry.**
*Converting chaotic tachograph and GPS data into clean operational profit.*

### The Mission
DLBR is not just another "tracking" software. We are a strategic partner for transport companies that trusts nothing but raw data. Our focus is automating what previously required hours of administration and high risks of compliance failure.
*   **Data Integrity:** Automated reconciliation of RDL (.ddd) files, GPS telemetry, and fuel transaction logs.
*   **Operational Precision:** Every manual process introduces a risk of administrative error. By automating ingestion, we ensure 100% data compliance with real-world events.
*   **Success Fee Mindset:** We build tools that directly recover lost revenue through automated excise tax refund processing.

### Fun Fact
Our team doesn't do cereal. We have raw HEX dumps for breakfast—preferably from corrupted French driver cards dated back to 2018. 🧙‍♂️
